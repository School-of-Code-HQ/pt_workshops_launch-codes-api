# Launch Codes API Puzzle

## API Documentation:

[Here's the link to the API you'll be using for this challenge.](https://task-escape-api.herokuapp.com/)

## Challenge:

Solve the API puzzle and write a script which sends the launch codes! Your challenge is to find out the correct launch codes that are hidden somewhere in the API. Once you have found the launch codes, finish the game by making a POST request - you will then be told whether your deduction is correct or not.

Finding the solution is only the first step - we want you to write a script which uses multiple API requests to arrive at the solution programatically. So, whatever steps you took to investigate the launch codes, you should write these steps out as functions that are called one after another, connecting the trail of breadcrumbs which end ina successful POST request.

Have fun!
